    <h2>Our Focus</h2>
    <p>
      The Early Childhood Education program is designed to teach students the aspects of teaching and working with young children, from birth through elementary age. Students will explore career pathways and develop the characteristics of successful teachers and childcare providers through practicums. Applying theoretical concepts to real-life situations, students are able to take what they have learned in the classroom and apply it to their rotation experiences where they learn how to meet the developmental needs and interests of young children in elementary school and daycare settings.
