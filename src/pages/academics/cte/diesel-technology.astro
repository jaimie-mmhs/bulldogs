    <h2>From Engines to Excellence</h2>
    <p>
      Medium- and heavy-duty trucks require educated and experienced technicians for their maintenance and repair.
Students in this program work on late-model trucks and diesel engines to gain this knowledge. They learn electrical and electronic theory, which they apply to computerized control systems used on todayâ€™s trucks. They also learn how to service and maintain steering, suspension, chassis and braking systems.
