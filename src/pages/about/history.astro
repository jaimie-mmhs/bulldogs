    <h2>History of Machias Memorial High School</h2>
    <p>
      In 1850 the residents of Machias established the first public high school
      in the town. It was located in Libby Hall atop Steele’s Hill. For those
      unfamiliar with the area, the hill is located on Lower Court Street. The
      hill was also the site of the famous Liberty Pole erected during the
      Revolutionary War Era by Machias rebels to caution the Crown of the
      anti-British sentiment in the town. The building can be seen in an
      original painting by former MMHS art instructor, Ed Foster. The building
      served the town until 1954 when the current Machias Memorial High School
      was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Libby Hall was a two-story structure which housed a full academic program.
      There was a large assembly room along with various classrooms. Drama
      productions and musical presentations were generally held within the
      building itself. The athletic teams became known as the Bulldogs, and the
      school colors became black and orange. Eventually, the school song,
      modeled after the World War I song There’s a Long Long Trail A-Winding,
      added a great deal of pride to the students and alumni of Machias High
      School and Machias Memorial High School. Although the traditional school
      song has never officially been replaced, a new school fight song, modeled
      after On Wisconsin, was adopted in the mid to late 1960’s and is now more
      commonly played at school events, much to the chagrin of older alumni.

      The original building began showing its age, and by the 1950’s residents
      of the town started planning for a new high school. The citizens wanted to
      honor the area veterans from World War I, Korea, and previous conflicts so
      the town named the new school Machias Memorial High School. The main
      building was constructed just up the road at what was then 109 Court
      Street. The new address is 1 Bulldog Lane. The school was built on the
      site of a large, open field with a new baseball field on campus. The
      building was very modern for its time and was a one-story structure with a
      very tall chimney. Rumor had it at the time that the chimney was so tall
      so that they could add a second story if need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building did not contain a gym, and basketball and plays were held at
      Powers Hall on the Washington State Teachers College campus. This fact
      made it difficult for our students to compete athletically and in fine
      arts competitions. The town fathers began to get input from the citizens
      of Machias that they wanted a new gym built which could house not only
      sporting events but also physical education/health classes, and dramatic
      presentations. Citizens of Machias came together and privately raised a
      large sum of money for the project. The gym was built on campus and was
      dedicated in 1961.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 1960’s the Navy and Air Force facilities were constructed and
      the early Baby Boomers began to hit secondary schools which increased
      enrollment dramatically. In the spring of 1965 a language lab, science
      room and a large study hall room were added to the West Wing: The school
      soon added Special Services programs as well as Industrial Arts programs
      including construction and automotive. A building was built beside the gym
      to house the Industrial Arts program. The school population reached its
      peak in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 21st Century the facility was updated further. Another small
      building was built which now houses the MMHS Alternative Education Program
      as well as the Jobs for Maine’s Graduates Program. Science labs were
      modernized, new ceilings and lighting were installed, and a new slanted
      roof was added to the main building. Under the leadership of our previous
      principal, Nicole Case, a new open air pavilion and outside exercise
      equipment which is open all community members were added. This year a new
      road and parking area were constructed behind the gym, and plans are in
      the works for a new gym floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we experienced an era of no to slow growth, MMHS is now
      experiencing a big growth in student population. It looks as though the
      future is so bright, we gotta’ wear shades!
