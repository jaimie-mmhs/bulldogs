        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-600">
          Prom is a fun, school-wide event that is a fundraiser for the Junior
          class. Traditionally this is led primarily by Juniors and requires
          fundraising, development of theme, event planning and a commitment to
          setup and tear down. All students from all classes are welcome to
          attend meetings and to participate in creative design, but the
          majority of the decision making and budgeting is left to the Junior
          class participants. In order to be successful this group needs to be
          comprised of dedicated members that are committed to the success of
          the event from fall through May.
